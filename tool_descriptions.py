If you think that, you can answer a question without using memory, do not use this tool.
Only add information that the user explicitly wants remembered (name, specific details, preferences, contextual information), 
not general topics. Use this function to create or update specific memory entries in the memory system. If an entry already 
exists for the given information, update it. Optionally, remove any outdated memory entries as needed. If the memory fails to 
be added, avoid repeatedly calling this function."""
